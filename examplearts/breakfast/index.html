<P><B>Breakfast is the first meal of the day usually eaten in the morning.[1] The word in English refers to breaking the fasting period of the previous night.[2] Various "typical" or "traditional" breakfast menus exist, with food choices varying by regions and traditions worldwide.

<P><b>In the Middle East region of Asia, Iftar refers to the evening meal when Muslims break their sawm (fast) during the Islamic month of Ramadan. Iftar is one of the religious observances of Ramadan, and is often done as a community, with people gathering to break their fast together. Iftar is done right after Maghrib (sunset) time. During the month of Ramadan, Muslims replace traditional breakfast with suhoor, an Islamic term referring to the meal consumed early in the morning by Muslims before sawm during daylight hours. The meal is eaten before fajr (dawn).[31]
